# Readme-Automaton
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## Description

This little project automates README.md file creation via bash console prompts. My motivation for this project was to learn more about node.js and hopefully more backend engineering. This little app will prompt the user for information in their README file for whatever project they're working on and generate a README.md file for that project.


## Installation

Simply clone the repo and run 'node index.js' in the bash console.

## Usage

This is node.js, so the user must go to the directory where index.js resides. From there the user can call index.js and simply follow the prompts to generate their README.md file.
